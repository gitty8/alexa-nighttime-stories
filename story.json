    "body": "There once were three little pythons. They were very happy pythons and loved to play. One day, they found a magical key outside their home. The three little pythons did not know what to do. The smallest python had an idea. Why don't we ask grandpa python? They all agreed and walked to grandpa python's home. There, grandpa looked at the key and realized this was no ordinary key. This was a key to a cookie jar! The three little pythons were so excited. They could now eat all the cookies they wanted."
